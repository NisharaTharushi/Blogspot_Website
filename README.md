## 🔧 Selenium Test Automation for "Blogspot Website 

###🌐 Project Overview

This project contains automated test scripts written in Python using Selenium WebDriver, the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for the demo healthcare appointment website.

🔗 [Blogspot Automation Website](https://testautomationpractice.blogspot.com/)

**Blogspot Website** is a comprehensive web-based playground for practicing UI test automation. It includes various real-world web components like forms, buttons, alerts, tables, sliders, and more — making it ideal for developing and testing Selenium skills.

## ✅ What This Project Covers

I built automated **Python test scripts using the Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.  
Each script focuses on:

- Functional and UI validations  
- Form field entry, submission, and validations  
- Header, buttons, and links testing  
- Table structure and data verification  
- Alerts, prompts, sliders, and dynamic elements  
- Cross-device responsiveness and accessibility checks

## 📄 Features and Pages Tested

The following pages were automated:

-  Home Page  
-  Online Training Page  
-  Playwright Page  
-  Udemy Page  
-  Blog Page  

Each page has its own Page Object class and corresponding test script.

Each page and feature is handled by dedicated test files and Page Object classes for maximum modularity and maintainability.
